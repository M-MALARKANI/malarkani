# Hi there

Hey there 👋
I’m Malarkani, a software engineer from India 🇮🇳

I build things by learning, breaking, fixing, and rebuilding.
When I don’t understand something, I don’t skip it. I dig until it’s clear.

My core tech stack includes Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap, mysql, Springboot, restapi,jsp and Servlet.
 Currently focused on backend, full-stack development, and system fundamentals.

I enjoy turning concepts into working projects.
From small logic programs to real-world applications, I build to understand deeply.

I’ve worked on multiple academic and self-driven projects,
and I’m actively building more to sharpen my real-world skills.

My goal is simple:
become a strong engineer, not just someone who knows syntax.
